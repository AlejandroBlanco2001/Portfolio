                        I am passionate about both the functionality and
                        visualization of bringing an idea to life. The
                        experience, its usability and how you feel plays a
                        fundamental role in how much you use an application. And
                        I completely agree with the phrase "You don't need more
                        space, you need less stuff."

                        I'm a senior studying computer science at the University
                        of the North ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´, I have a diploma in data science from
                        ESAP, and a certification in data science from
                        Correlation One's DS4A program (Yes, one of my biggest
                        interests is data scienceðŸ¤«).

                    <p>
                        I am happy researching, looking for new ideas and
                        learning new ideas. I am currently working as a
                        fullstack developer focused on the frontend. I am not
                        available for freelancer work, but you can contact me
                        anyway and say hello.
