                        I am passionate about both the functionality and
                        visualization of bringing an idea to life. The
                        experience, it's usability and how you feel, plays a
                        fundamental role in how much you use an application. My
                        style is focus on minimalistic interfaces, "You don't
                        need more space, you need less stuff."

                        I'm a senior studying computer science at the
                        Universidad del Norte ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´, I have a diploma in data
                        science from ESAP, and a certification in Data science
                        from Correlation One's DS4A program (Yes, one of my
                        biggest interests is data scienceðŸ¤«).

                        I am happy researching, looking for new ideas and
                        learning new ideas. I am currently working as a

                        available for freelancer work, but you can contact me
